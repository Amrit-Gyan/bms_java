This Project is built by me where
User can open thier account,
They can 
1.Create an account
2.Deposit
3.Withdraw
4.Check Balance

It is an Console-based Project where I have implemented concept of inheritance for 
better reusability, interfaces for secure purpose and features of Oops.

There are 4 main files :- 
	1. XYZBank.java
	2. Bank.java
